            "answer": "The significance of the DRN being \"open-ended\" is that it allows for continuous re-rolls if a 6 is rolled, which means there is no fixed upper limit to the result, making even extremely unlikely outcomes possible and enhancing the game's realism.",

            "answer": "A 46% chance of beating an opponent indicates that when two values are evenly matched, the probability of one value rolling higher than the other using the same type of dice is slightly less than even, reflecting the inherent randomness and challenge in the game.",

            "answer": "A unit with higher attack skill has a better chance of hitting an opponent in Dominions 6 because the difference between the unit's attack skill and the opponent's defense skill is compared using the DRN system, where a positive difference increases the probability of a successful hit.",

            "question": "How does the DRN system ensure that unlikely events can still occur in Dominions 6?",
            "answer": "The DRN system ensures that unlikely events can still occur by using open-ended rolls, where rolling a 6 allows for continuous re-rolls and additions. This mechanism means that even with low probabilities, there is always a chance for unlikely events to happen.",

            "answer": "The DRN plays a crucial role in determining the outcome of combat in Dominions 6 by providing a randomized element to attack and defense rolls. The result of these rolls, influenced by the DRN, determines whether attacks hit or miss, adding variability to combat outcomes.",

            "answer": "The chance of success might be less than 50% even when two units are evenly matched because the probability table reflects the need to roll higher than the opponent. With evenly matched values, the inherent randomness results in a 46% chance of success rather than an even 50%.",

            "answer": "A \"morale check against 12\" means that a unit's morale plus a DRN is compared to the number 12 plus a DRN. The unit must roll higher than the total of 12 plus the DRN to pass the check, with the probability determined by the difference between the unit's morale and 12.",

            "question": "How does the DRN system affect the design of units and strategies in Dominions 6?",
            "answer": "The DRN system affects the design of units and strategies by introducing an element of randomness that players must account for. Units with higher attack or defense skills have better odds in combat, but the open-ended rolls mean that even weaker units can occasionally succeed, encouraging diverse and flexible strategies.",
