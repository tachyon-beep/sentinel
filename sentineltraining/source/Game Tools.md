# Game Tools

Dominions 6 has a number of options under this menu to create new pretenders, as well as manage pretenders you have already created. There is also a map editor, a tool for creating random maps with custom settings, as well as a shortcut to the directory where Dominions 6 stores your files.

# Playing a multiplayer game

The game supports many ways of playing multiplayer: hotseat play (multiple players on the same computer), online play (either with a private server or on the official server), or even play-by-email (PBEM). If you are the only human player in the game (all other nations are AI) then it is a solo game and you can skip this chapter.

Because turns in Dominions 6 are resolved simultaneously, it works very well in multiplayer. Everyone can do their turns when they want and when everyone is finished a new turn will be generated.

## Playing a hotseat game

Starting a hotseat game is done in the same way as a single player game. Just add extra human players when choosing the participants and you are done.

## Playing a network game

The easy way to play online is to use the official game server for Dominions 6. Choose Network and then Enter Game Lobby from the main menu.

From the game lobby it is easy to set up a game for others to join, or to join a game someone else has set up. It should be pretty self explanatory if you are familiar with how to set up a solo game of Dominions 6.

**Note:** Remember to add a password to your pretender when playing online. Without a password anyone will be able to peek at or alter your turns.

Setting up your own personal game server is also possible, but more complicated. The recommended way to play multiplayer in Dominions 6 is via the game lobby. For instructions regarding PBEM or private game servers you have to read in the old Dominions 5 manual (free to download on www.illwinter.com).

# Playing the Game

Once you have started a game and are presented with the main game screen, you'll need to become familiar with the interface. At first you are viewing your home province, to view a different province you should right-click on it (this can be changed to left-click in the preferences if desired).

* To view a different province, right click on the province.
* To select a commander, left-click on his icon and he turns white (selected).
* To give a commander order to move, you left-click the province to which you want him to move.

Right-clicking, in many cases, gives you further information. For example: To get information on a unit in almost any screen, you right-click on the unit. The same applies when you want information on magic items or spells.

## Basic Game Functions

At the top right of the map screen is a row of buttons that are used for most things. These are divided up into five sections.

### The province buttons

The province buttons performs actions for the current province only. These buttons are (letter in parenthesis is the keyboard shortcut):

- **(e) End turn**: This ends the current turn. In a single player game this initiates the host procedure.
- **(t) Army setup**: This is where you can assign your units to commanders, change formations, and array your forces on the battlefield. See Army Setup on page 43 for more information.
- **(y) Army setup at destination**: This is an alternative to the regular army setup. Instead of commanders currently present in the province commanders that will be present next turn are shown. See Army Setup on page 43 for more information.
- **(u) Patrolling army setup**: This is an alternative to the regular army setup showing only patrolling commanders. This is mostly useful in fortified provinces. See Army Setup on page 43 for more information.
- **(r) Recruit unit**: This opens the recruitment panel for a given nation and shows the units available for recruitment in the selected province. This only works for provinces the player controls.
- **(b) Mercenaries**: Players can see which mercenaries are available for hire. You can bid on these by clicking on the name of the company you wish to bid on.
- **(i) Read Province Chronicles**: Here you read some information about the province and its inhabitants as well as all past important events that has occurred in the province.

### The nation buttons

The nation buttons are not dependent on the current province. These buttons are the following:

- **(m) Read messages**: Allows you to read the beginning-of-turn messages.
- **(s) Send messages**: Allows you to send messages, items, or gold to other players.
- **(F1) Nation Overview**: This screen gives a global picture of your units and provinces. You can buy province defense, or go straight to a province using this screen. It also keeps track of magic site searches.
- **(F2) Score graphs**: If score graphs are enabled, you can see a running comparison of the strengths of the various nations in terms of provinces owned, total dominion, army size, etc. You can also see the names and status (human or AI) of all pretenders, and whether or not they are still in the game.
- **(F3) Hall of Fame**: Commanders who have survived the most fights and killed the most enemies receive a Heroic Ability for entering the Hall of Fame. This ability continues to improve as long as the hero is listed here.
- **(F4) Pretenders**: Displays a list of all pretenders in the game unless information on other players was disabled during game creation.

### The magic buttons

The magic buttons are the following:

- **(F5) Research**: Takes you to the Research screen where you can access spell research.
- **(F6) Global Enchantments**: Shows you the global enchantment spells currently affecting the world.
- **(F7) Magic item treasury**: Shows the magic items you have stored in your treasury.
- **(F8) Magic item overview**: An easy way to see all magic items in your kingdom (both in treasury and equipped on commanders) and learn where they are.
- **(F9) Thrones of Ascension**: This displays the Thrones of Ascension active in the game (if any).

### The game buttons

The game buttons can be used to change settings and to end the turn.

- **(Esc) Options**: Adjusts music and video settings, and allows you to save, and quit the game.
- **(e) End Turn**: When you have completed your turn, this button saves your move to a file in the game folder, or uploads it to the server if you are playing an online game. You may still go back and adjust your move, or even start over from scratch. Exception: In a solo game, hitting End Turn automatically hosts the current turn.

### The plane buttons

On the row underneath are buttons for all the planes. These buttons will be greyed out for any plane that you currently have no access to. Usually the planes are these:

- **(1) Pantokrator's realm**: This is the overland world where most of the game will take place.
- **(2) The realm beneath**: The caverns underneath.
- **(3) The void**: The empty space where horrors thrive. Usually you will not end up here.

You can hide all buttons and commanders by hitting the "h" key. This way only the map will be visible.

Some buttons may be active (like the Statistics button) but not yield any information if the score graphs have been turned off in the game options when the game was created.

The Province buttons refer only to the province you have selected. They may do nothing if the province you have selected is owned by the enemy.

Most of these buttons will be discussed in detail in further sections.

# The Map

Maps in Dominions 6 have one characteristic feature: they are divided up into provinces. These provinces are delineated by the greyish lines. However, the lines are really only for your visual reference; the game engine does not use them in any way. Instead, what is important is which province is a neighbor of which other province. You can see this by looking at the yellow dotted lines, they go between the neighboring provinces. The yellow lines should be seen by default, but if it is turned off, hitting the [Ctrl+8] key to Toggle Neighbors will turn it on again.

The table on this page shows all the display toggles that can be used to control what you see on the map.

## Keyboard shortcuts to control map view

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Arrows | scroll map |
| Home | go to home province |
| Ctrl+Home | go to Pretender / Disciple |
| g / # | goto province nbr |
| End | zoom x0.5 |
| Insert | zoom to cover screen |
| Delete | zoom to fit entire map |
| Page Up / Ctrl+Up | zoom in |
| Page Down / Ctrl+Down | zoom out |
| Ctrl+f | map filter menu |
| Ctrl+1 | toggle flags/forts |

| Ctrl+9 | toggle province names |
| Ctrl+0 | toggle remote rituals |

Provinces are designated by both a name and a number. The number can be used to quickly jump to provinces with the 'g' key, for goto province number.

All game mechanics in Dominions 6 are based on provinces. Movement is done from province to province. Units are recruited on a province-by-province basis. Each province has a number of attributes that govern its contribution to the game.

## Province attributes

When a province is selected, you can see its attributes in a box on the right side of the screen, provided that you have some way of gaining this information (either through scouts, dominion influence or the proximity of friendly provinces). If you don't have any way to gather this information, all you'll get is the name and map number of the province. Most information about a province will be unavailable unless you actually own it (it is friendly to you, displaying your national flag).

If you have dominion over a province, you will be able to see its income and scales, even if you do not control it. Once you have scouted a province, the province name and location is remembered and you can always see it even if you do not have friendly units in it. For more information about how much information you will receive on any given province, see Scouting and Scrying on page 30.

The province attributes shown in the main province screen break down as follows:

### Terrain

Terrain is shown in the top of the province info box. It is very important for determining how valuable that province will be in terms of income, resources, supply, and magic sites. Farmland tends to have high population (and therefore income) but low resources and few magic sites. Highlands tend to be just the opposite. See the Terrain Type Bonus table for details.

There can be multiple terrains in the same province in which case the bonuses add up. The River terrain indicates an abundance of freshwater in the province and applies to all lands adjacent to the river.

Terrain also allows or restricts multi-province movement. See the section on Movement on page 47.

There is a major distinction between land and underwater provinces. Underwater provinces cannot be entered by units without a special ability that allows it (such as amphibian, aquatic, or water-breathing), they do not contribute resources to fortresses on land and cannot be crossed by flying units. Units with sailing may cross water provinces, but may not remain there at the end of a turn.

### Terrain Type Bonuses

| Terrain | Population | Resources | Magic Sites |
|---------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| Plains | - | - | - |
| Mountain Ranges | - | excellent | many |
| Forest | low | high | many |
| Highlands | low | high | - |
| Swamp | very low | - | many |
| Waste | extremely low | - | abundant |
| Farm | very high | low | few |
| River | high | - | - |
| Sea | low | - | - |
| Deep Sea | very low | high | many |
| Kelp Forest | high | - | - |
| Gorge | low | high | abundant |
| Cave | low | - | - |
| Drip Cave | - | excellent | - |
| Crystal Cave | very low | high | abundant |
| Forest Cave | high | - | many |

## Population

Population determines income, and is affected by many factors: Growth/Death scales, patrolling, dominion, pillaging, and random events. The population in a province sets the base income from that province:

Income base = Population / 100.

Click on the Population line to see the growth or death rate of the province's population.

## Income

A province contributes its income rating to the owner's treasury every turn. Income accumulates in the treasury. The number shown is after all modifications. Income is determined by multiple factors, including population, dominion scales, fortress administration, and unrest.

Modified Income = (Population / 100) * (dominion scale modifiers) * (1 + fort administration / 200).

If the province has unrest, this number is:

Final Income = Modified Income / (1 + (unrest * 0.02).

If a province cannot trace an unbroken line of friendly provinces back to a friendly fort, it does not produce income that turn. Taxation requires communication. In disciple games income can be traced through the territories of your allies.

## Resources

The resource value of a province, representing raw materials needed to make weapons and armor. Resources are reduced by unrest, like income. Resources are collected by forts from neighboring provinces. A province only produces half of its potential resources for use in that province unless it contains a fort. The number shown is the number actually being produced, not the potential.

Note that in the capsule screen, resources are displayed as hammers. As a province's resources are allocated to recruitment, the hammers in the capsule screen are progressively greyed out.

Resource availability in a province is reduced by unrest according to the formula:

Final Resources = Resources / (1 + unrest*0.01)

Thus, an unrest level of 100 means a province produces only one half of its normal resources. Furthermore, no units may be recruited in a province with an unrest level of 100 or greater.

Building a fort in a province greatly increases the number of resources available there.

| Unrest | Income | Resources |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| 10     | 83 %   | 91 %      |
| 25     | 67 %   | 80 %      |
| 50     | 50 %   | 67 %      |
| 75     | 40 %   | 57 %      |
| 100    | 33 %   | 50 %      |
| 150    | 25 %   | 40 %      |
| 200    | 20 %   | 33 %      |

## Recruitment Points

Recruitment points represent the ability of populated areas to concentrate the resources necessary to recruit and equip forces. Recruitment points depend on the population present in a province, as follows:

| Population    | Recruitment Points |
|---------------|-------------------|
| 0             | 20                |
| 1-5,000       | pop/100           |
| 5,001-10,000  | pop/200           |
| 10,001-20,000 | pop/300           |
| 20,001-40,000 | pop/400           |
| 40,001+       | pop/500           |

Add up rows until you reach the population level in the province. Example: A province has a population of 6000. It will get 20+5000/100+1000/200 recruitment points.

The recruitment bonus for forts is then applied (e.g. +50% for palisades). Order scales also affect recruitment points by +10% per step.

## Dominion

This represents the religious dominance being exerted into that province. Only one pretender can have dominion in a given province. If it is positive, the dominion is yours and is represented by a white candle.

Negative dominion is someone else's dominion, and is represented by a black candle. If you have a priest in a province with hostile dominions you will also get to know whose dominion it is.

## Capsule screen

The income, resources, and dominion in a province can be displayed (and toggled off) by hitting the [Ctrl-4] key. The hammers (resources) and standards (recruitment) become progressively greyed out as the player allocates them for production during a turn. Turning on the capsule screen can be a good way of scanning to see if there are any provinces with underallocated resources or production.

## Unrest

Unrest represents turmoil in a province and reduces both income and resources there. Unrest can be raised by random events, enemy spies, blood hunting, magic sites, certain targeted spells, or global enchantments. Unrest can be reduced by patrolling, province defense, order scales, magic sites or random events. Unrest will also negatively affects the chances of capturing blood slaves, or of successfully finding stealthy units by patrolling.

Once unrest reaches 100 it will no longer be possible to recruit any units or commanders from the province. The maximum amount of unrest is 500 or one point per 10 population, so once the population reaches zero there can no longer be any unrest.

## Supplies

The supply rating of a province determines how many units the province can support. If more units occupy a province than can be supplied by the indicated supply rating, starvation occurs. Units consume different amounts of supply based on their physical size (see Units for more information on this). The supply rating in a province is determined by multiple factors.

Population-based supply is calculated from the population present in a province, modified by the Growth/Death and Heat/Cold scales. The first 15,000 population in a province generates supplies at 1 supply point per 30 population. Additional population generates 1 supply point per 60 population. This is modified by the Growth/Death scales (first) and the Heat/Cold scales (second) to arrive at a Population-Based Supply number.

Fortress-based supply depends on the province's proximity to a fortress. If the province in question is within four provinces of a fort, fortress-based supply is added to the population-based supply calculated above. This depends on the fortress' Admin rating (see section on fortresses below). Only the highest fortress-based supply is used if there is more than one nearby fortress.

Supplies from forts = (Administration * 6) / (Distance + 1)

Example: A province with 21,000 population has Growth 1 and Heat 3 dominions in it. It generates 500 supply points for the first 15,000 population, and 100 supply points for the remaining 6,000 population for a total of 600 supply. Supplies are increased by 20% for the Growth 1 dominion, increasing the total to 720. The Heat 3 dominion, however, reduces this amount by 30%, or 180 supply points, for a population-based supply of 540.

The province is also three provinces away from a Castle (Admin 30). This generates an additional 30 supply points. The province has a final supply value of 540 + 30 = 570.

### Supply Usage

The number of supplies being used by the units currently occupying a province is shown under Supply Usage. If there are not enough supplies in a province to supply all of the units currently occupying that province, starvation may occur.

### Starvation

If Supply Usage exceeds Supplies, starvation will occur. When this situation occurs a number of troops will start to starve. The supply consumption of the starving troops will be about as large as the deficit in supplies.

Starving units will become starving the first month (-4 morale penalty) and have a 5% chance of getting diseased. If they should be affected by starvation while they are already starving the chance of getting diseased is increased to 50%. Diseased units will take damage each month as usual, until they die.

Units with an appropriate survival skill have a 50% chance of being completely unaffected by starvation and another 50% chance of not getting diseased.

Starvation ends as soon as a there is no longer a lack of supplies, but diseased units will not get rid of the diseased condition.

## Defense

Defense indicates the level of provincial defense present in a province. Raising provincial defense costs an amount of gold equivalent to the new level purchased. (Thus, level 2 costs 2 gold, going from level 2 to level 3 costs 3 gold, going from level 10 to level 11 costs 11 gold, and so on.) The first level of provincial defense is gain automatically and for free. Additional benefits are gained at levels 10, 15 and 20.

Provincial defense costs no upkeep, and is fully restored after a battle if the owner does not lose control of the province.

Provincial defense levels can be raised by clicking on the word Defense in the main province screen. Shortcut key [d]. Provincial defense levels cannot be voluntarily reduced. However, it takes at least 10 population to support each point of province defense. Province defense will be automatically reduced to a level which can be supported by the population of the province.

## Corpses

The number of unburied corpses in a province. This is important for some spells (e.g. Raven Feast) and for raising undead. You can only see this information if you have a death mage or an undead priest in the province. If the nation's normal priests can reanimate undead (a special property of certain nations), they can see the number of corpses, too.

## Dominion scales

Dominion scales are separate from dominion, although the two are related (see chapter on Dominion for more specific information). The level of dominion scales in a province is shown by icons/text in the main province window.

Much of this information can also be seen in the Nation Overview screen [F1], which will also show commanders and their locations. You can set defense and give orders in this screen, as well as use it to go directly to a province in the main map. This makes it quite useful. New players should get their [F1] fingers in shape. The specific finger used to access this screen may or may not be important.

## National summary

Regardless of which province is selected, the national summary will be at the top of the screen. At the top is the name of your pretender god. Below the god's name is the treasury that lists the total amount of money your nation has. Income is the total income prior to paying upkeep costs, which are shown in parentheses. In the upper left-hand corner is a symbol denoting the season. If you mouse over this it will tell you the exact season in the game and the current turn number. Press the Treasury button to see a list of all gold you have spent so far this turn.

All units in the game (except for most summoned units) cost upkeep each turn equal to their gold cost divided by 15. Sacred units and slaves cost half as much upkeep (gold cost divided by 30). Press the Income button to see a list of all income and upkeep costs.
