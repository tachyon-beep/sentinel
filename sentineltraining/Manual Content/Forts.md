Forts
Forts are structures which exist on the map and can be
upgraded. Forts serve as collection points for resources,
supply depots for distribution to surrounding provinces, and
shelter for troops in the event of a siege. Each fortress type
has different attributes.
Fortress types
The numbers for “Build” indicate gold/months required.
Because each level of fort must be built on the previous one,
the months listed are for that specific stage only. Thus, it
would take 1000 gold and five months to build a palisade,
and then another 600 gold and three months to upgrade it
to a fortress. The attributes don’t stack, so the admin,
recruitment, supply, and wall integrity of the previous fort
are replaced by the new one
The era (Early, Middle, or Late) of the game dictates what
fort levels are available to most nations. The standard forts
are: Early Age: fortress; Middle Age: castle; Late Age:
citadel. Some nations (like Yomi) can only build primitive
forts, while others (like EA Ermor) can build advanced forts
compared to the standard of a particular era. The Nation
Overview screen will inform you if the nation you are
viewing has primitive or advanced forts.
Some nations, such as Marignon and Ulm in the middle era,
have masons who are able to construct forts one level
higher than normal. This is not specifically a nation trait, but
simply a trait on a particular commander that happens to be
available to that nation at that time. A commander with the
mason trait can be used to construct higher level forts. The
grand citadel is only available to those nations who can
construct a citadel and also have a mason. It has the same
icon as the citadel.
Admin
The admin value of a fort determines the percentage of
resources from neighboring provinces that the fortress can
collect. It also propagates supply into nearby provinces. The
formula for this is (Administration * 6) / (Distance + 1). Thus,
a fortress with admin 50 contributes 150 supply to adjacent
provinces. Four provinces is the maximum distance for this
supply propagation.
Administration also increases the income of a province by
Admin / 2%. Thus, a fort with an Admin value of 30 would
increase the income by 15% of any province in which it is
built.
The admin value also propagates supplies to nearby provinces

Defense
The defense value of a fort represents the number of points
of damage that must be done to a fort by an enemy siege
before it can be attacked. Each turn a comparison is made
between the strength of the sieging and besieged forces at a
fortress. The difference between these forces determines
the amount of damage done to the fortress' defense value.

the amount of damage done to the fortress' defense value.
Supply
The supply value of a fortress determines only how many
units can be supplied inside that fortress in the event of a
siege. It does not affect the distribution of supply to
surrounding provinces. Each turn a fortress is under siege,
its supply value is divided by the length of the siege to
determine the supply points available on that turn to the
besieged units. Thus, on the fifth turn of a siege of a fortress
with a supply value of 100, the fortress provides besieged
units with 20 supply.

Castle Guards
and Wall
Defenders
Forts also have
defense (termed
Castle Guards
and Wall
Defenders) that
will help defend
the fort when it is
being stormed.
The Wall
Defenders will be
stationed on the walls and the Castle Guards will start
behind the gate of the castle. These units will be replenished
for each fight, just like normal province defence.
Castle Guards and Wall Defenders contribute to the repair
strength of the defending army (see Sieges, page 71)
Wall Defenders also have the following attributes:

* never run out of ammunition.
* can be attacked from the stairs inside the walls, or by Flying or
Ethereal units (or missiles – see below).
* 20% increased missile range.
* some protection from missiles (see Missile Combat, page
65). The wall has the same defense as a tower shield, but it
has a Protection value of 30. The defenders use the best of
their own shield or the wall defense.
The number of Castle Guards and Wall Defenders depends
on the fort level.
Fortress statistics
The statistics for each fort are listed when you click on the
Fortification button in the province interface (also the [f]
key). Some forts give bonuses to Commander Points and/or
Recruitment Points, as listed in the section on fortress types.
How forts collect resources
The calculations for provincial resources can seem
confusing. The most important thing to remember is that a
province’s resource pool [see page 22] only consists of
half of that province’s potential resource production as long
as it has no fort. A province will only gain the benefit of its
full production when that province has a fort. Furthermore,
once a province has a fort, the fort uses its Admin value to
draw resources from adjacent provinces, within certain
restrictions. These are:
* A land fort cannot draw resources from an adjacent sea
province and vice versa.
* Forts cannot draw resources from adjacent provinces that also
contain forts.
* No fort can draw resources from an adjacent enemy province.
Once you take these factors into account, it is relatively
straightforward to calculate how provincial resources are
affected by fort production. We follow this with an example,
which was discovered to probably have been written by
Ulmish masons while preparing a plan of attack against
Arcoscephale during the many wars that
plagued the Middle Era.
In the Early Spring of Year 5 of the
Ascension Wars, Arcoscephale was
building a fort in the province of Gaieta.
Before the fort was constructed, the
resource situation looked as it does on
the campaign map on this page. The
province names and resource counts are
listed. The black/white colors are simply
for readability and have no other special
meaning. Note that Gaieta has 31
resources available for use itself, and is
adjacent to six other provinces: Tenvir,
Solian, Livenmark, Lyratos, Cacevic
Highlands, and Yrik Balkor. The last two

provinces are mountain provinces and have comparatively
more resources available.
After four months, the fort was constructed through the
efforts of Asios, the Hoplite Commander, at a cost of 1000
gold. The resource picture changed to the one depicted
below.
How did the province of Gaieta become such a production
powerhouse? For several reasons. First, the province was
producing only half of its potential resources before, as it
had no fort present. Recall that when there is no fort
located in the province, it has only half of that province’s
potential resource production. Now that it has a Palisades
located there, Gaieta is able to produce
to its full potential of 61 resources. But
this is still much less than the 125
shown! This is because the Palisades
has an Admin value of 15, meaning it
draws 15% of the resources present in
each adjacent province. But if you add
the resources shown on the map that
are adjacent to Gaieta, and take 15% of
these, you still don’t get to 125. What is
happening? The answer is that the
Admin value of a fort draws from the
total potential resources of each
adjacent province. Thus, Yrik Balkor
has only 46 resources available for
production in the province itself, but it
has its full potential (92 resources)
available for collection by the fort in
Gaieta, and thus contributes 15% of 92,
which is 13.8. Now you can see how the
Palisades reaches an astonishing 125 in
resource production: 62 + (54 + 32 + 80
* 76 + 98 + 92) *0.15 = 64.8. With some
rounding, this becomes 63 and when
added to 62 equals 125 resources
available here.
In Late Spring of Year 6 of the Ascension
Wars, Asios the Hoplite Commander
completed another Palisades, this time
in Yrik Balkor, and the resource map our
scouts obtained changed again.
Of course Yrik Balkor’s resources went
up dramatically, but why did Gaieta’s
drop? This is due to bullet point 2 on [page 26]: Forts
cannot draw resources from adjacent provinces that also
contain forts. Thus, Gaieta loses the 15% of the 92
resources that were previously available for it from Yrik
Balkor, which is 13.8, rounded down to 13, and 125 – 13 =
112, which is the new total for Gaieta. As for Yrik Balkor, it
cannot draw from Gaieta, either. It does, however, draw
from the remainder of its adjacent provinces, including the
ones Gaieta is drawing from, if they are adjacent to both
(like Tenvir and Cacevic Highlands). In Yrik Balkor’s case,
this is (98 + 78 + 48 + 78 + 54)* 0.15 which equals 53.4, with
rounding becomes 52 and when added to the base 92
produced by Yrik Balkor, equals 144 resources.

What if Asios built a fort in Pantokrator’s Bounty, across the
river from Fowanshire? Could it collect Fowanshire’s
resources? Yes. Even though the river is only crossable at
the bridge, river traffic on small craft is sufficient to allow
for resources to flow to the fort.
In Late Fall of Year 8 of the Ascension Wars, an army led by
Balthazar, the Commander of Ulm, and his legions of
Infantry of Ulm, Black Plate Infantry, and Guardians, as well
as a squad of Sappers, besieged and stormed the forts at
Yrik Balkor, Gaieta, and Arcoscephale itself, for which
Balthazar gained great renown and reputation as a hero of
Ulm of the Middle Era. His deeds remain legendary.
Temples
Temples are the second of the three buildings you can
construct in Dominions 6. Temples help you spread your
dominion, either by directly inducing dominion spread
[Exception: Mictlan, Early and Late Eras] or by providing a
location for blood sacrifices (which are only available to
certain nations – see the Dominion chapter). Temples also
give priests a bonus when preaching.
A temple can only be built in a friendly province. If an enemy
takes control of a province with another nation’s temple in
it, the temple is immediately razed. If there was a temple in
a province you captured, the razing will be reported in the
turn’s events, along with the capture. Only one temple can
exist in a province at a time. Temples cost 600 gold to build,
although there are exceptions. Man and Marverni only pay
half this cost for a temple. Pangeaea pays half in a forest
province, while late age Gath pays double everywhere.
Clicking on the Temple button on the lower right of the
screen tells you how much dominion you spread each turn
and how likely it is to be successful. This is broken down into
the number of spread chances per month. Each temple can
spread dominion, as can the pretender, prophet, and
nation's home province. All of this is explained in detail in
the Dominion chapter.
Laboratories
Laboratories (or labs) are the last building type available.
Labs serve as magic gem collection points and centers of
research. They allow mages in that province to perform the
Research order, enable transfer of gems from the national
inventory, and allow the casting of ritual spells. For a
detailed description of these game elements, see Magic
(starting on page 32). Ritual spells can only be cast in a
province with a laboratory.
Labs cost 600 gold to build, and some nations are able to
build cheaper labs, such as Arcoscephale, as well as
Pangeaea who pay half in forest provinces (just like their
temples).
Magic Sites
Magic sites are not buildings per se (although there are
some sites which are buildings, such as the Firbolg Fortress
and Jervellan Wall) but rather locations within a province
that possess some special attribute, like magic gem
production, unique unit recruitment, or other benefits. A
province may have multiple magic sites, not all of which may
be visible at once. Magic sites are more likely to be found in
certain terrains like forests, wastes and deep seas and less
likely in certain other terrains like plains and farmlands.
Magic sites do not necessarily appear when you capture a
province. Instead, the sites must be discovered by
searching. There are four levels of difficulty. A mage must
have skill in the magic path of the site equal to the difficulty
level of the site in order to find it when using the Search for
Magic Sites order. Thus, a level 3 Nature mage will find any
difficulty 1, 2 or 3 sites in a province when he/she searches,
but will not find a difficulty 4 site. When searching, level 4 in
a path is the highest level ever required to find a site. There
are spells which will automatically reveal all sites of a given
path in a province (for example, Haruspex reveals all Nature
magic sites), or even all magic sites, period (Acashic
Knowledge).
Some sites (like the Void Gate) allow certain types of units to
enter them for certain benefits. Entering such sites is a
movement order available to eligible commanders.
Sites which permit the recruitment of national units (such as
the Forest of Avalon) only
grant this ability to that
nation (in this example,
Man). Enemy players who
capture such a site will still
collect the magic gems
produced by it (if any) but
will not be able to recruit
the special units.
There is no guarantee that
a site will be usable to a player when found. A Cave may
allow a Blood mage to recruit demons, but if the player has
no Blood mages, he will not be able to use it.
A magic site may have some additional requirement before
it becomes useful. For example, the Library allows the
recruitment of sages, but not until you build a laboratory.
The role-playing reasons for this should be obvious.
Not all magic sites have beneficial effects. Some are sources
of chaos, death, or other negative powers. These may cause
unrest or other ill effects, and will happen whether or not
the magic site causing the trouble has been discovered.
Province Defense
Province defense (PD) is a way of protecting a province
without actually stationing an army there. Defense is
purchased at a cost of whatever the new defense level will
be. You will get the first level of province defence for free,
but the rest has to be purchased by spending gold equal to
the level you are purchasing. So to buy the second level of
province defense costs 2 gold, while the tenth costs 10 (and
to get to 10, you have to buy the intervening levels as well,
so ultimately a PD of 10 costs 2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 = 54).
At defense level 1, a nation gets a commander and some
troops. Each level of defense thereafter gives you more
troops, which are shown as you increase your province
defense. The maximum level of province defense is 100. At
level 20 you get additional types of commanders and troops.
Every 10 points of province defense reduce unrest by 1
point in that province per turn. So 53 points of province
defense would result is a recurring unrest reduction of 5
each turn.
Starting at level 15, province defense will have a chance of
detecting stealthy units in that province. Each point of
province defense above 15 gains one point of patrolling
strength, so that a PD level of 25 has a patrol strength of 11.
This is about the same as an equivalent number of patrolling
infantry units.
A province can only support provincial defense if it has
sufficient population. For every point of province defense,
there must be 10 points of population. If this is not the case,
province defense will be reduced accordingly at the end of
the turn. This is the only way in which province defense can
be reduced, other than having the province be captured,
which wipes out all existing province defense, or
relinquished (in disciple games), which reduces provincial
defense by 25%. Once you have built province defense, you
cannot reduce it in future turns. The down arrow does not
work then.
Certain undead nations (e.g. Ermor - Ashen Empire) can
have province defence without having any population to
support it. In provinces without a fort they will have 1 point
of PD (usually only a single undead commander), in
provinces with a fort they can have up to 100 PD (consisting
of undead soldiers).
Unrest
Unrest represents people being unhappy with the ruler of
the province. This can be the result of many different
unhappiness-generating events: a difference between the
nation which controls the province and the one that exerts
dominion over it will do it, since the people worship one god
but are ruled by another. Blood hunting will definitely do it
– imagine how happy you would be if someone came
through your village and rounded up a bunch of young
virgins for a blood sacrifice. Enemy spies and bards can do it
because that is their job. Random events such as ill omens
can cause unrest to increase. You should consider whether
an ill omen would make you uneasy as well.
Unrest reduces the amount of income and resources a
province generates. A province with unrest of 100 or
greater will not permit the recruitment of new units. Thus,
you can shut down an opponent’s production by
destabilizing his or her provinces.
Mercenaries
Mercenaries are units who are willing to fight for gold. They
sell their services to the highest bidder. They are hired for a
period of three months (turns). Clicking on the Mercenaries
button will display the mercenaries available for hire, as well
as currently hired mercenaries, their employer (indicated by
the national flag) and the time of service remaining. When a
mercenary band’s contract runs out, it will again become
available for hire, except on that turn only, the previous
employer’s bid counts double. It is only good for that turn,
and if the mercenaries are hired by someone else, the bonus
is lost and instead that nation will gain the bonus when those
mercenaries complete their contract.
Some nations get a discount on the price for certain
mercenary bands and some nations (e.g. Ermor - Ashen
Empire) must pay more for most bands.
Scouting and Scrying
Players will not necessarily have any information about a
province besides what it depicted on the actual map. There
are many ways to gather information about provinces, and
these methods differ in what information is learned.
Scout in province
Reveals owner, military info, fort constructions, and the
province history. Reveals temperature of current and
neighboring provinces
Priest in province
As scout + dominion strength and dominion owner
Spy in province
As scout + income, supplies, magic sites, unrest, province
defense level and more accurate military info than an ordinary
scout
Dominion in province
Reveals owner, income, temperature. Reveals dominion
strength of neighboring provinces
Scrying a province
Reveals owner, very accurate military info, income, supplies,
magic sites, province defense level, history, temperature,
dominion strength, dominion owner, fort constructions, unrest
Owning a province
Reveals everything about the province. Reveals location and
name for provinces 1-3 steps away. Early era only reveals
names of neighboring provinces, middle era reveals name of
provinces two steps away, late era reveals the names of
provinces up to three steps away. Reveals owner, unreliable
military info and temperature for neighboring provinces.
AI Opponents
When you start a new game you get to choose how many
and what level of AI controlled opponents you want. The AI
players play using the same rules as human players, except
for any possible resource bonuses depending on the level
that has been selected for them. See the AI Bonus table
below to see what kind of boost (or penalty) they get to their
income. This bonus applies to money, resources,
recruitment points and magic. Note that there is no bonus
to commander recruitment rate or to holy points.
AI Name Bonus
Easy AI -30%
Normal AI 0
Difficult AI +30%
Mighty AI +60%
Master AI +100%
Impossible AI +150%
Thus killing an AI army will really set them back the amount
of gold it cost to create it. Although they might get the gold
back quicker than a human player if they are above Normal
difficulty level and thus get a resource bonus.
The AI players also get an information bonus and knows
which countries are owned by which players without
needing scouts everywhere. This is seen as a fair shortcut as
experienced human players are very good at guessing this
without the need of that many scouts.
