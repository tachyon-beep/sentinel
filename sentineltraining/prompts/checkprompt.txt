You will be evaluating the accuracy of question-answer pairs related to the game Dominions 6. You have access to the official Dominions 6 manual, which you should use as your primary source of information. 

Your task is to determine whether each question-answer pair is true or false based on the information in the manual. You will be given a series of pairs in the following format:

<pair>
<question>[Question text]</question>
<answer>[Answer text]</answer>
<difficulty>[Difficulty level]</difficulty>
<category>[Category]</category>
</pair>

For each pair, follow these steps:
1. Read the question and answer carefully.
2. Compare the information in the answer to the content in the Dominions 6 manual.
3. Determine if the answer is accurate and consistent with the manual.

Provide your evaluation in the following format:
- If the answer is true, write the pair number followed by "True."
- If the answer is false, write the pair number followed by "False," and then provide a brief explanation of why it's incorrect based on the manual.

Here's an example of how your output should look:

1. True.
2. False. The manual states that unique artifacts can be forged once per three game turns, not once per game turn.

Now, evaluate the following question-answer pairs:

{{QUESTION_ANSWER_PAIRS}}

Begin your evaluation with the first pair, numbering each response sequentially.
