# Dominions 6 QA Pair Generation Prompt

You are tasked with creating a series of question-answer pairs based on a page from the Dominions 6 manual. This information will be used to fine-tune a Large Language Model (LLM), so it's crucial to create high-quality, comprehensive pairs that cover all the information on the page. The goal is to ensure the LLM understands the intricacies of the game mechanics and can accurately respond to related queries.

## Manual Page Content

The content of the manual page is provided below. Use this information as the basis for generating your QA pairs:

<manual_page>
[Paste the content of the Dominions 6 manual page here]
</manual_page>

Your task is to generate at least 50 question-answer pairs that thoroughly cover all the information presented in this manual page. Consider the complexity and criticality of the information, as well as the importance of accuracy. Complex, critical, or detailed information should generate a larger number of pairs.

## Guidelines for Creating QA Pairs:

1. Clarity and Precision:
   - Ensure questions are clear and direct.
   - Answers should be precise and directly address the question.

2. Consistent Terminology:
   - Use terminology consistently as used in the manual.

3. Comprehensive Coverage:
   - Cover all aspects of the information presented.
   - Generate multiple pairs for complex or detailed topics.

4. Include Examples:
   - Where appropriate, include examples in answers to illustrate complex concepts.

5. Avoid Redundancy:
   - Each question should address a unique aspect of the content.

6. Variety of Question Forms:
   - Use a mix of question types: definitions, explanations, comparisons, scenarios, implications, purposes, etc.

7. Context and Background:
   - Provide sufficient context in answers for better understanding.

8. Conciseness and Informativeness:
   - Be concise while ensuring the answers are informative and complete.

9. Logical Flow:
   - Ensure the answer logically follows from the question and provides a clear explanation.

10. Domain-Specific Knowledge:
    - Incorporate domain-specific knowledge and terminology accurately.

11. Prioritization:
    - Cover the most critical concepts first and more extensively.

12. Difficulty Levels:
    - Include a mix of easy, medium, and difficult questions to ensure varied complexity.

13. Cross-referencing:
    - Create questions that relate different concepts within the manual page.

14. User Perspective:
    - Frame questions from the viewpoint of different user types (e.g., beginners, experienced players).

15. Negative Examples:
    - Include some questions about what certain game mechanics or concepts are not, to help clarify boundaries and prevent misunderstandings.

Generate at least 50 question-answer pairs to cover all the information in the manual page comprehensively. Each pair should focus on a specific piece of information or concept. Ensure that your questions and answers are varied in complexity and depth, ranging from basic factual queries to more complex, analytical questions.

## Additional Instructions:

- Cover All Aspects: Address definitions, processes, examples, implications, and purposes related to the content.
- Include Examples: Where possible, provide concrete examples to illustrate complex concepts.
- Review for Quality: Ensure that the questions and answers are accurate, consistent, and comprehensive.
- Maintain Logical Flow: Ensure that each answer logically follows the question and provides sufficient context.
- Avoid Redundancy: Ensure that each question-answer pair covers unique information to avoid repetition.
- Consider User Perspective: Ensure questions are framed in a way that users of different experience levels can understand.
- Balance of Pairs: Aim for a rough distribution of difficulty levels: 20% easy, 50% medium, 30% hard.
- Fact Checking: Double-check all information against the provided manual page to ensure accuracy.
- Handling Ambiguity: If you encounter any ambiguous or unclear information in the manual page, create a question-answer pair that addresses this ambiguity and explains how it might be interpreted.

## Example QA Pair:
<pair>
<question>What is the Dominions Random Number (DRN) in Dominions 6?</question>
<answer>The Dominions Random Number (DRN) is a special dice roll used in Dominions 6. It involves rolling two six-sided dice (2d6). If either die shows a 6, one is subtracted from that die, and it is re-rolled and added to the total. This process can repeat if the die continues to roll a 6, potentially leading to very high numbers. This type of roll is known as an "open-ended" 2d6 roll.</answer>
